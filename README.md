## Known bug/limitation/feature
Currently, powerup holograms display by replacing the normal powerup text. However, sometimes even when powerup items are visible (e.g. the sword, armour, head) the nametag isn't visible due to render distance, so the powerup won't get a hologram. This means for some larger maps, you won't be able to see all holograms at once.
Originally I was planning to fix this by detecting what the powerup item was (e.g. the floating sword, armour), however I realised that would make this mod more of a cheat than a QOL, as you can't see those floating items through walls, however my hologram would be visible through walls.
