## Known bug/limitation/feature
My mod overrides Hypixel's default holograms. However this feature is limited to Hypixel's entity render distance, so not all holograms will be shown at once.
The only way to fix this issue would be to render custom holograms based on the floating item (e.g. the sword/armour), but as you can't see these items through walls, this would be an unfair advantage.
